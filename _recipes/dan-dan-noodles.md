ingredients:
- 2 12 oz. boxes of gluten-free fettuccine or spaghetti
- 2 8 oz. packages button mushrooms
- 12 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 tsp. fresh ginger, grated
- 2 tsp. Szechuan peppercorns, crushed
- 1/2 cup liquid aminos or soy sauce
- 12 oz. broccolini or broccoli, cut into bite-size pieces
- 4 oz. carrots, cut into matchsticks (or frozen carrots)
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1/2 cup tahini
- 1/4 cup lime juice
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds
- 4 scallions, chopped

directions:
- Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain well in a colander, then return to the saucepan and cover to keep warm.
- In a nonstick skillet over medium heat, cook mushrooms, garlic, ginger, and Szechuan peppercorns until all liquid has released and evaporated, about 10 minutes.
- Add 1/4 cup liquid aminos (or soy sauce) and cook until mushrooms are coated. Remove from skillet.
- Add broccolini (or broccoli) and carrots to same skillet. Cook over medium until crips-tender, about 3 minutes. Add vegetable broth 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time as needed, to keep vegetables from sticking. Remove vegetables from skillet.
- Add remaining broth to skillet and bring to a boil. Remove from heat.
- In a bowl, whisk together tahini, lime juice, maple syrup, and remaining 1/4 cup liquid aminos (or soy sauce). Add warm broth, 1 tablespoon at a time, until sauce reaches a thin paste consistency.
- Toss cooked fettucini in sauce. Arrange fettuccine in sauce. Arrange fettuccine in bowls. Top with mushrooms and vegetables. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and scallions. Spoon any remaining broth around the edges of each bowl.
