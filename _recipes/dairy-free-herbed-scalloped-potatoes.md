tags: sides

ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon dairy free butter - to grease the bottom and sides of a 9"x13" casserole or butter two smaller casseroles
- 6 cups russet potatoes - peeled and sliced
- 4 tablespoons dairy free butter
- 4 tablespoons flour
- 3 cups dairy-free milk - unsweetened
- 1 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme

directions:
- Peel and slice potatoes to measure 6 to 7 cups.
- Place in a large bowl of water as you go along slicing. This will keep the potatoes from turning brown.
- Melt the dairy free butter in a large saucepan.
- Add the flour and stir over medium-heat for a few minutes. Keep stirring so that it is all blended well.
- Pour in the dairy free milk.
- Bring to a low boil stirring often.
- After the sauce comes to a boil turn down the heat to medium and cook until it is smooth and thickens a bit. About 10 to 15 minutes.  Add salt and pepper and stir.
- Layer the potatoes in a large 9" x 13" casserole dish, overlapping in a staggered type of style. This lets the sauce get down in between the nooks and crannies.
- Pour the sauce all over the top.  Cover with a lid or foil.
- Bake at 350Â° for 30 minutes.
- Uncover and bake another 60 minutes.
- Remove from oven and sprinkle fresh herbs over the top.
- Let stand for 10 minutes. The sauce will thicken.
