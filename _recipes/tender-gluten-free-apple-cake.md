ingredients:
- 1 1/2 pounds baking apples (about 3 large apples), peeled, cored and diced (a mix of Empire, Gala, and green apples works really well)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 cup + 2 tablespoons (158 g) all purpose gluten free flour (I used Better Batter)
- 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
- 10 tablespoons (140 g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar
- 2 eggs (100 g, weighed out of shell) at room temperature, beaten
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

directions:
- Preheat your oven to 325Â°F. Grease well a 9-inch round cake pan, and set it aside. Place the diced apples in a large bowl, and toss with 1 teaspoon of the ground cinnamon and the lemon juice, then set the bowl aside.
- In a separate medium-sized bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, remaining 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and nutmeg, and whisk to combine well, then set aside. In a separate large bowl with a hand mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add the sugar, then the eggs and vanilla, beating to combine well after each addition. Add the dry ingredients in two batches, beating until just combined after each addition. The batter will be thick but light. Scrape about two-thirds of the cake batter into the bowl of apples, and mix to coat all of the apples in the batter. It will be very chunky.
- Scrape the remaining one-third of the cake batter into the prepared cake pan and spread into an even layer with a moistened spatula. Scrape the chunky apple-packed cake batter into the pan on top of the base layer of batter, and spread again into an even layer with a moistened spatula.
- Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil, and place in the center of the preheated oven. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil cover from the pan and return to the oven to bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with no more than a few moist crumbs attached (about another 20 minutes). Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before carefully transferring to a wire rack for about 15 minutes before slicing and serving while still warm.
