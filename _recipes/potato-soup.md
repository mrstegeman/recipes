ingredients:
- 2.5 lbs potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 lb bacon, chopped
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 3/4 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 tsp salt
- pepper, dried thyme, and dried chives, to taste

directions:
- Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. When the pot is hot, add the chopped bacon to the pan and cook until crispy. Once the bacon is done remove it from the pan and allow it to drain on paper towels.
- Next, add the diced onion, garlic, and butter to the pot. Cook for a few minutes until the onion becomes translucent.
- Next, add the potatoes, chicken broth, salt, and pepper to the pot. Bring the soup to a boil and then lower the heat. Let the soup simmer for 25-30 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.
- When the potatoes are tender, add the milk. Next, add one cup of soup to a blender and blend until mostly smooth. Pour the soup back into the pot. Then, stir in two tablespoons of cornstarch into 1/2 cup of water and whisk into the soup. Add seasonings to taste.
- Stir in half of the crisped bacon. Serve the soup with the rest of the crispy bacon and on top.
