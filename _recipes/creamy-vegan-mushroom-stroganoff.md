tags: pasta

ingredients:
- 2 (5 oz) pkgs baby spinach (or 16 oz frozen)
- 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 2 (13.5 fl oz) cans coconut milk
- 2 small pkgs fresh thyme
- 8 cloves garlic
- 24 oz gluten-free fettuccine pasta
- 1 1/2 lb white mushrooms
- 4 medium yellow onions
- extra virgin olive oil (or broth)
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 2 tsp paprika
- 2 tsp salt (plus some for pasta water)
- 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar (or equal parts molasses, lemon juice, and tamari soy sauce)
- 1/3 + 1/8 cup cornstarch
- 4 tbsp tamari soy sauce

directions:
- Fill a large pot halfway with water, cover, and bring to a boil. Uncover, salt, add pasta, and stir for a few seconds. Cook until desired firmness, 8-10 minutes.
- Meanwhile, preheat a large skillet over medium heat.
- Peel and small dice the onions.
- Once the skillet is hot, add oil (or broth) and swirl to coat the bottom.
- Add the onions to the skillet; cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 5-6 minutes.
- Wash and slice mushrooms. Peel and mince garlic.
- Add mushrooms, garlic, and spices to the skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms are softened, 6-7 minutes.
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the coconut milk and cornstarch.
- Add coconut milk mixture, broth, soy sauce, and vinegar to the skillet. Stir and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, 7-8 minutes.
- Wash and dry thyme. Slide leaves off the stems; discard the stems. Add leaves to the skillet and stir to combine.
- Wash and dry the spinach (skip if it came pre-washed). Add spinach to the skillet in handfuls, waiting for the spinach to wilt slightly before adding the next handful.
- Drain pasta and add to skillet with the sauce. Toss to combine.
- To serve, divide the pasta and sauce between plates. Enjoy!
