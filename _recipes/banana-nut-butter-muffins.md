title: "Banana Nut Butter Muffins"
tags: dessert

ingredients:
- 4 eggs, separated
- 4 very ripe bananas, cut into chunks
- 2 teaspoons Gefen Vanilla Extract
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 (18-ounce) jar cashew or Gefen Almond Butter

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line 20-24 muffin tins with baking cups and set aside.
- In a food processor fitted with an S blade, beat egg whites until stiff, then slowly incorporate yolks.
- Add ripe bananas and mix well for at least three minutes until a creamy, fluffy batter forms. (The longer you mix the bananas with the eggs, the fluffier your muffins will be.)
- Add vanilla extract, baking soda, and nut butter and mix well.
- Divide batter between prepared muffin tins.
- Bake for 20-23 minutes; do not overbake so that muffins stay moist.
