title: "Butternut Oat Risotto"
tags: breakfast

ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup steel cut oats
- 4-5 cups broth
- 1/2 medium butternut squash
- 1/4 cup green onions, sliced
- 2 tablespoons parmesan cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper

directions:
- In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.
- Stir the steel cut oats into the oil and let them toast for 2-3 minutes.
- Add about 1 cup of broth and let the mixture come to a bubble, stirring frequently. Once the first cup of broth has cooked into the oats, add another 1/2-1 cup of broth, repeating the process until all the broth is used and the oats are cooked and creamy. You can add more water if you need more than the 5 cups of broth.
- While the oats are cooking, either roast your 1/2 squash (at 425 for 30-40 minutes) or microwave it until the squash is tender.
- Once the oats are softened and creamy, remove the pan from heat and stir in the cooked squash, green onions, parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Serve warm.
