title: "Salmon Patties"
tags: seafood

ingredients:
- 2 cans salmon (drained, skin and bones removed)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- 1/2 small onion, minced OR 1 tsp dried onion powder
- 2 cloves minced garlic OR 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tbsp mustard (dijon or regular)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- sea salt and fresh ground pepper to taste

directions:
- Drain canned salmon, then dump into a medium sized bowl. Using the back of a fork, break salmon apart and crush bones. Mix in eggs, then bread crumbs, and lastly, all of the seasonings.
- Preheat a cast-iron pan to medium heat, and add a few pats of butter and some extra virgin olive oil (you can do just one or the other, or even use coconut oil instead, but the mix gives such a great flavor).
- You'll have to use your hands to shape these patties as you go to make them. I just put a big dollop in my hands, shape it best as I can, and flatten slightly once in the pan if needed. I don't bother to pre-shape them, but just do it as I go.
- Once cooked halfway through and nicely browned (2-3 minutes), flip over and allow to cook all the way (another couple minutes).
- That's it! Super easy. It tastes best if it has some time to sit, to allow flavors to mix.
