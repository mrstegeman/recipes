tags: dinner

ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided
- 4 green onions, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons minced or grated fresh ginger
- 4 cups cooked and chilled rice (I used short-grain brown rice)
- 1/2 cup frozen peas
- 1 small bunch kale, roughly chopped (after ribs and stems have been removed)
- 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce, or more/less to taste
- 2 teaspoons oyster sauce (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
- 3 eggs, whisked
- freshly-cracked black pepper

directions:
- Sauté the green onion, garlic and ginger. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the white and light-green parts of the green onions and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute, stirring often.
- Sauté the rice. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and increase heat to high heat.  Once the butter has melted, add in the rice and spread it out in an even layer.  Let the rice cook undisturbed for about 2 minutes or until crisp on the bottom.  Give it a good stir and repeat, letting it cook for about 1-2 minutes or until it is crispy.
- Add in the peas, (green) green onions and kale. Add in the peas, half of the reserved green parts of the green onions, and kale, quickly tossing the kale with the rice one handful at a time until it is incorporated and begins to wilt.
- Add in the seasonings. Drizzle the soy sauce, oyster sauce and sesame oil evenly over the rice and toss to combine.
- Scramble the eggs. Push the rice to one side of the pan and cook the eggs in the other, stirring them frequently until scrambled and cooked through.
- Taste and season. Give the rice a taste and season with black pepper and/or extra soy sauce as needed, to taste.
- Serve. Remove from heat and serve immediately, garnished with remaining green onions.
