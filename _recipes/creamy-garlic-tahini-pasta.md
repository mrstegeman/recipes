title: "Creamy Garlic Tahini Pasta"
tags: pasta

ingredients:
- 2 (12 oz) boxes gluten free linguine
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1 cup tahini paste
- 5 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 cup cashew milk
- 1 teaspoon salt

directions:
- Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season generously with salt. Cook pasta according to package instructions.
- While pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. Add garlic, tahini, lemon juice, water, almond milk, and salt to the blender. Pulse until you get a super smooth and creamy sauce, scraping the side of the blender with a spatula as needed.
- When the pasta is done cooking, drain it in a colander and return it immediately to the pot. Pour sauce over and toss thoroughly to coat the pasta. Taste and adjust salt if needed. Serve immediately.

* For some extra zing, add some lemon zestalong with the juice. 1/2 tsp should be just right.
* You can finish this off by garnishing with some chopped herbs like fresh basil or parsley – whatever you have on hand. Or sprinkle with some lemon zest, a generous grating of black pepper, dried chilli flakes or red crushed pepper, or a sprinkling of sesame seeds.
* This pasta is best served straight away, but if you have leftovers, reheat them with a bit of milk (the sauce will thicken a lot and be sticky as it cools down).
* Some tahini brands are thicker than others. The sauce should be creamy and somewhat thick, but not too thick either. Add more milk or water, one tablespoon at a time until you reach the perfect consistency. Alternatively, if you’re not sure what the best consistency should be, add more milk (little by little) directly on the pasta while your tossing it with sauce.
