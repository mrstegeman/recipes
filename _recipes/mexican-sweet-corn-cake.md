ingredients:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1/3 cup masa (corn flour)
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen corn (thawed, if frozen)
- 1/4 cup cornmeal
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
- In a large bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Add the masa and water, and beat until incorporated. Set aside.
- Pulse the corn in the food processor. Leave the corn chunky! Stir the corn into the butter mixture.
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the milk, and stir to combine.
- Stir the corn meal mixture into the butter-corn mixture just until incorporated. Pour into an ungreased 8×8" baking pan.
- Place the baking pan into a 13×9" baking dish with water filled up 1/3 of the way full. Cover the corn cake with foil.
- Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 50-60 minutes. Cool 10 minutes, then use an ice cream or cookie scoop for serving.
