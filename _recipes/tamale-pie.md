directions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly grease or spray with nonstick cooking spray an 11x7 inch casserole dish.
- Browning the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat. After 3-4 minutes add the onions bell peppers and jalapeno. Continue cooking until the beef is browned and the onions and bell peppers are soft.
- Reduce the heat to low and add the garlic. Cook for 1 minute stirring continuously. Remove any excess grease from the skillet.  Add the fire roasted tomatoes, corn, tomato paste, chili powder, and cumin. Simmer for 10 minutes.

* You can substitute diced or crushed tomatoes if you can not find the fire roasted tomatoes.
* If you have a sensitivity to spicy foods omit the jalapenos. Please see section below on picking the best mild jalapenos.
* Pro Tip – don’t risk dropping the ground beef in the sink to drain the fat. Simply tilt the pan and use a paper towel to absorb the grease.
* If the pie browns too much before the topping is completely set top with a piece of aluminum foil loosely placed over the top.
* Let it cool for about 10 minutes before digging in. I find it best to cut through with a sharp knife and use a sturdy spatula to plate it.
* Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave at reduced power.
* Freeze in a sturdy freezer container for up to 2 months. Defrost in the refrigerator overnight.
