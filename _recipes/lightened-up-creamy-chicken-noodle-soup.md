tags: soup

ingredients:
- 1 Tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 chopped yellow onion
- 1 1/2 cups sliced carrots
- 3 stalks sliced celery
- 4 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1/4 cup Pamela's Artisan Flour
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- pinch of dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 8 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 medium potato, peeled and diced (around 1 and 1/2 cups)
- 2 cups shredded roasted chicken
- 1 can full-fat coconut milk
- 4 cups uncooked noodles
- green onions
- lemon juice

directions:
- Over medium heat, melt the butter in a large pot or dutch oven (4 quart or larger). Add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Saut√© for around 7 minutes or until the vegetables are soft. Add flour, oregano, pepper, thyme, and salt. Stir and cook for 3 minutes.
- Next, add the broth and potato. Give everything a quick stir, then increase the heat to medium-high. Bring the soup to a boil, without stirring, and boil for 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, partially cover the pot, and allow to simmer for 25 minutes or until the potatoes have softened. Add the chicken and coconut milk. Cook for 10 minutes or until the the soup has thickened. Once again, taste the soup and add more seasoning as desired. Serve the soup warm.
- Cover and store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. To reheat, simply pour into a pot over medium heat and cook until warm. Feel free to add more chicken broth to the leftovers if it's too thick-- I always do. (Soup thickens in the refrigerator as the noodles and potatoes soak up the liquid.)

**Freezing:** Freeze soup for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator the day before eating, then reheat on the stove until warm.
