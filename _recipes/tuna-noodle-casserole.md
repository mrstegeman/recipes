title: "Tuna Noodle Casserole"
tags: seafood, pasta

ingredients:
- 8 ounces sliced mushrooms
- 8 ounces pasta
- 1 tablespoon oil
- 1 medium white onion, chopped
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1/4 cup white flour
- 2 1/2 cups milk
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1 cup vegetable or chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste
- Minced garlic
- Italian seasoning
- Garlic powder
- Onion powder
- Turmeric
- 2 10-ounce bag frozen broccoli florets, thawed and chopped
- 24 ounces canned tuna (4 6-ounce cans)- boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 F. Lightly oil a 9” x 13” casserole and set aside.
- Bring several cups of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Drain pasta in a colander and set aside.
- In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, heat the oil, adding onions, celery, minced garlic, and mushrooms once hot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are fragrant and translucent, about 6 minutes. Stir in the flour, whisking constantly until there are no lumps and the flour just begins to smell toasty about 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in ½ cup of broth, whisking until well combined. Add the milk, 1/2 cup at a time, followed by the mayonnaise and the rest of the broth. Add in other seasonings. Cook, stirring constantly until mixture is smooth and slightly thickened.
- Add the broccoli, tuna and cooked pasta to the sauce, tossing well to combine. Transfer the mixture to the prepared casserole dish and bake until bubbly and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.
