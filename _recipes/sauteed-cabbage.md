tags: sides

ingredients:
- 1 head cabbage, cored and chopped
- 1 medium white onion, chopped 
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced 
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 2 teaspoons onion powder 
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder 
- Salt and pepper to taste 
- Optional: red pepper flakes

directions:
- Prep cabbage and onion. 
- Add butter to large skillet over medium high heat. Sauté onion for 3 minutes.
- Add cabbage to skillet and toss/stir often (use tongs to make it easy) until it is as soft as you’d like, about 15 minutes.
