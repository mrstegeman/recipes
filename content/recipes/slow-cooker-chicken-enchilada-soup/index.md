## Ingredients
* 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound)
* 2 cups good-quality chicken stock
* 1 1/4 cup (or 1 10-ounce can) red enchilada sauce, homemade or store-bought
* 2 (14-ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 (14-ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, with juice
* 1 (15-ounce) can whole-kernel corn, drained
* 1 (4-ounce) can diced green chiles
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 white onion, peeled and diced
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon salt, or more/less to taste
* optional garnishes -- chopped fresh cilantro, diced avocado, diced red onion, shredded cheese, sour cream, tortilla strips/chips

## Directions
* Add all ingredients to a large slow cooker, and stir to combine. Cook for 3-4 hours on high heat or 6-8 hours on low heat, until the chicken is cooked through and shreds easily. Use two forks to shred the chicken.
* Serve warm, with optional garnishes.
* You can also refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 5 days. Or freeze it for up to 3 months.
