For extra-moist pork chops, would recommend brining them for an hour beforehand like Food & Wine suggested!  Just stir 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. ground red pepper into a quart of water.  And then add the pork chops and let it all sit together in the refrigerator for an hour.  Then pull them out and continue with the recipe as directed above.

From [Gimme Some Oven](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/cocoa-and-chili-rubbed-pork-chops/).

## Ingredients
* 2 boneless pork loin chops
* 2 tsp. unsweetened cocoa powder
* 2 tsp. ancho chili powder (or regular chili powder)
* 2 tsp. light brown sugar
* 1 Tbsp. olive oil
* sea salt & freshly ground black pepper

## Directions
* In a bowl, mix the cocoa, brown sugar, and chili powder together until well-blended. Sprinkle a little less than 1 tsp. on the tops of each pork chop, and pat/rub in. Flip over and do the same on the other sides. Let sit for about 5-10 minutes, then sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides.
* Heat oil in a skillet over medium-heat. Test to see if the oil is ready by dripping a drop or two of water in the skillet. (No sound – pan is too cold. Splatter – too hot. Sizzle – perfect!) Add pork chops and cover for about 5 minutes. (Mine were not super-thick, so only left then in for 4 minutes.) Then uncover and flip, and cook for a few more minutes until thoroughly cooked (between 145-160 degrees). If juices start to form on top of the chops, they’re definitely done!
