## Ingredients
* 1 large sweet potato, cut into 1 inch cubes
* 2 cups broccoli florets
* 2 large carrots, sliced
* 2 cups brussels sprouts, quartered lengthwise
* 1 onion, sliced (use your favorite onion or what you have on hand)
* 1 can (15 oz.) garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained  and rinsed
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper or lemon-pepper, to taste
* 2 cups cooked quinoa or grain of choice (about 1/2 cup per person)
* (sauce) 2 cans (15 oz.) cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
* (sauce) 3 – 4  tablespoons nutritional yeast
* (sauce) 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* (sauce) 3/4 – 1 cup vegetable broth (start low and add as needed)
* (sauce) juice of 1 good size lemon
* (sauce) generous pinch of red pepper flakes
* (sauce) mineral salt, to taste
* (sauce) 1 tablespoon fresh chopped basil, thyme, parsley, chives, sage or tarragon (choose your favorite or what use what you have on hand)

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
* Line roasting pan/baking dish with silpat, parchment paper or grease lightly with neutral oil. Add vegetables to roasting pan and toss to coat with olive oil. Arrange vegetables in a single layer (as much as possible), sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Roast vegetables until tender and lightly browned, about 45 minutes, mixing once halfway through.
* Start your grain of choice while vegetables are cooking. Quinoa will take about 30 minutes.
* Prepare your sauce by placing all the ingredients into your food processor/blender, except for the herbs, and process until smooth. Add extra broth as needed to thin. Add in herbs and pulse once or twice. Place sauce in a small saucepan and heat over low heat, uncovered, until warm, stirring occasionally.
* Serve vegetables with grain of choice and a nice helping of sauce over top. Serve warm.
