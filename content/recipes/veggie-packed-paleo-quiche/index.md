This dish is pretty basic, but hugely adaptable. Here are a few suggestions...

* Add or replace the red peppers with zucchini, asparagus or mushrooms. If you are adding more veggies than the recipe calls for, reduce the eggs accordingly.
* Replace the onion with leeks.
* Replace the spinach with cake, collard greens or chard.
* Throw in whatever fresh herbs you have on hand (chives and thyme are my favorites for this quiche).
* Go the Spanish Tortilla route and add thinly-sliced white or sweet potatoes.
* Make the (prebaked) crust ahead of time, cool completely, and tightly wrap with plastic wrap. Freeze until you are ready to make the quiche, then bring the crust to room temperature before filling.
* Skip the crust altogether.
* Make it ahead without a crust, slice into portions and freeze. Reheat each piece in the microwave as you need them. (Note: you can freeze it with the crust, but expect the crust to be a bit soggy when you defrost it)
* Swap in liquid egg whites for some or all of the whole eggs. I typically use a 3-6 whole eggs and the rest whites. The conversation is 3 Tablespoons liquid egg whites = 1 whole egg.
* Increase the nutritional yeast or replace with cheese for a more prominent "cheese" flavor. If you increase it, you may want to reduce the salt slightly.

## Ingredients
* 1 grain free pie crust (pre-baked)
* 1 package frozen spinach (about 1 cup, defrosted and drained)
* 1 large red bell pepper (reserve 6-8 slices for decoration, if desired, sliced)
* 1/4 cup very thinly sliced sweet onion, loosely packed
* 2 Tablespoons nutritional yeast, optional, or replace with cheese of choice
* 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh herbs, optional
* 12 whole eggs
* 2 Tablespoons unsweetened vanilla almond milk or full fat coconut milk
* 1/4 teaspoon coarse salt
* 1/4 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper

## Directions
* Preheat the oven to 350F.
* Toss together the spinach, bell pepper, onion, nutritional yeast and fresh herbs, if using.
* Add to pre-baked crust.
* In the bowl that you used to mix the veggies, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt and pepper.
* Pour egg mixture over veggie mixture and garnish with reserved red pepper slices.
* Bake for 60-75 minutes or until crust is browned, top is domed and has a sheen to it, and center is firm.
* Cool slightly before serving, and completely before storing in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
