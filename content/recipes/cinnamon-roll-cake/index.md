## Ingredients
* (cake) 3 cups flour
* (cake) 1/4 tsp salt
* (cake) 1 cup sugar
* (cake) 4 tsp baking powder
* (cake) 1 1/2 cups milk
* (cake) 2 eggs
* (cake) 2 tsp vanilla
* (cake) 1/2 cup butter, melted

* (topping) 1 cup brown sugar
* (topping) 2 tbsp flour
* (topping) 1 tbsp cinnamon
* (glaze) 2 cups powdered sugar
* (glaze) 5 tbsp milk
* (glaze) 1 tsp vanilla

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
* Spray a 9x13 glass baking pan with cooking spray. Set aside.
* Cake -- In an electric or stand mixer add the flour, salt, sugar, baking powder, milk, eggs, and vanilla. Once combined well, slowly stir in the melted butter. Pour into the prepared 9x13 baking pan.
* Topping -- In a large bowl, cream butter, brown sugar, flour and cinnamon together until well combined and creamy. Drop evenly over the batter by the tablespoonfuls and use a knife to marble/swirl through the cake (make sure it is mixed really well!). Bake at 350 for 35-40 minutes or when a toothpick inserted near the center comes out nearly clean.
* Glaze -- In a medium bowl, mix the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla with a whisk. Drizzle evenly onto warm cake.
* Serve warm or at room temperature.
