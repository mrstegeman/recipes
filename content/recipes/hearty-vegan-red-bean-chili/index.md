## Ingredients
* 2 cups finely chopped yellow onions
* 2 cups finely chopped red bell peppers
* 1 cup coarsely chopped fresh poblano chile peppers
* 1/2 cup millet or quinoa
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped and seeded fresh jalape√±o
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 4 cups vegetable broth or water
* 3 15-oz. cans diced fire-roasted tomatoes, undrained
* 2 15-oz. cans red kidney beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 tablespoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed
* 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder or finely chopped chipotle chile pepper in adobo sauce
* 2 tablespoons paprika
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* Sea salt, to taste
* Corn tortillas or steamed rice, for serving

## Directions
* In a Dutch oven cook the first six ingredients (through garlic) over medium-low 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add water, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, as needed to prevent sticking.
* Add the next eight ingredients (through paprika). Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, 30 minutes or until millet/quinoa is tender.
* Stir in lemon juice and season with salt. Serve hot with tortillas or rice.
