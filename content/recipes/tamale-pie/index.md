* You can substitute diced or crushed tomatoes if you can not find the fire roasted tomatoes.
* If you have a sensitivity to spicy foods omit the jalapenos. Please see section below on picking the best mild jalapenos.
* Pro Tip – don’t risk dropping the ground beef in the sink to drain the fat. Simply tilt the pan and use a paper towel to absorb the grease.
* If the pie browns too much before the topping is completely set top with a piece of aluminum foil loosely placed over the top.
* Let it cool for about 10 minutes before digging in. I find it best to cut through with a sharp knife and use a sturdy spatula to plate it.
* Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave at reduced power.
* Freeze in a sturdy freezer container for up to 2 months. Defrost in the refrigerator overnight.
