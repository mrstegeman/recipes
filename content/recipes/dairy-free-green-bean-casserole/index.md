## Ingredients
* 2 lbs fresh green beans, cut in half
* (Dairy-Free Cream of Mushroom 'Soup') 1 tbsp avocado oil, or another neutral oil
* (Dairy-Free Cream of Mushroom 'Soup') 1/2 sweet onion, finely diced
* (Dairy-Free Cream of Mushroom 'Soup') 12 oz white mushrooms, finely chopped
* (Dairy-Free Cream of Mushroom 'Soup') 4 cloves garlic, minced
* (Dairy-Free Cream of Mushroom 'Soup') 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* (Dairy-Free Cream of Mushroom 'Soup') 3 cups unsweetened dairy-free milk, (we used almond)
* (Dairy-Free Cream of Mushroom 'Soup') 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* (Dairy-Free Cream of Mushroom 'Soup') 1/2 tsp salt
* (Dairy-Free Cream of Mushroom 'Soup') 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* (Crispy Onion Straws) 1 large sweet onion
* (Crispy Onion Straws) 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
* (Crispy Onion Straws) 1/2 tsp salt
* (Crispy Onion Straws) 1/4 cup avocado oil, or another neutral oil

## Directions
* Preheat the oven to 375°F and prep a 9 x 13 or 8 x 8 baking dish with cooking spray.
* Heat a large pot of lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Throw the green beans into the boiling water and boil for 5 minutes. Drain the green beans and set aside.
* To make the cream of mushroom, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 tbsp oil. Add the onions and saute for 3-5 minutes until onions are translucent.
* Reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped mushrooms, salt, and saute for about 5-8 minutes until the mushrooms have cooked down completely. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.
* Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and saute for about 1 minute until all of the mushrooms are covered with flour.
* Using a whisk, whisk in the dairy-free milk until completely combined. Continue to whisk until the mixture has thickened, about 3-5 minutes.
* Add the pepper, garlic, powder, and continue to cook for another 3-5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Once the soup is thick, remove from the heat.
* To make the fried onions, toss the sliced onions in a bowl with the flour, cornstarch, and salt until completely covered.
* Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat with the oil. Add the onions in one even layer and don’t touch for 1-2 minutes. Once the onions have browned on one side, flip them using a spatula and brown the other side.
* Once the onions are golden dark brown, remove them from the pan and onto a paper towel to drain any excess oil.
* To assemble the casserole, pour the blanched green beans into the prepared baking dish and pour the cream of mushroom evenly over the top of the beans. Sprinkle the fried onions over the top.
* Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes is up, turn the oven up to 400°F and bake for another 10 minutes. The casserole will be bubbling - this is okay.
* Remove from the oven and let cool for about 10 minutes before serving.
