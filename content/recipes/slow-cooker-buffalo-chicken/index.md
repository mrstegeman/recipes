## Ingredients
* 1 onion, diced
* 3 large boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1 ¾ cup Frank's Red Hot Wings sauce
* ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
* 1 tsp seasoned salt
* 1 tsp dried parsley
* ¾ tsp ground black pepper
* ½ tsp garlic powder
* ¼ tsp onion powder
* ⅛ tsp dried thyme
* ¼ tsp dried dill
* ½ tsp dried oregano

## Directions
* Add diced onion to the bottom of the slow cooker and then chicken breasts. In a bowl, combine all other ingredients. Pour over chicken breasts, ensuring that the slow cooker is at least half full, and no more than three-quarters of the way full.
* Cook on high for 3-4 hours, or until chicken is cooked through. Remove chicken to cutting board and shred using two forks (it should shred easily once done). Place shredded chicken back in the crock pot and stir so that chicken is combined evenly with the onions and sauce. Serve on sandwiches, over salads, in quesadillas, and more!
