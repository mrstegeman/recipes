## Ingredients
* 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce (or Tamari if gluten free)
* 1/2 cup chicken stock (or vegetable broth if vegan)
* 1 tablespoon corn starch (or arrow root)
* 1 tablespoon honey (or agave nectar if vegan)
* 1 teaspoon sesame seed oil
* 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
* 2 inch piece of ginger, peeled and grated or finely minced (or 1 tablespoon ginger paste in a squeeze tube, and other readers have had success with 1 tablespoon ground powdered ginger)
* 2 garlic cloves, grated or finely minced
* Vegetables and meat of your choosing for the stir fry

## Directions
* Whisk all ingredients together. Adjust the amount of sauce you add according to how much stir fry youâ€™re making. When adding to your stir fry, allow to cook for 3 full minutes to allow the corn starch to thicken the sauce.
* Makes 1-1/4 cups. Will keep refrigerated in an airtight container for 1 week.
