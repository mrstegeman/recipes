## Ingredients

### CHIA PUDDING

* 1 ½ cups dairy-free milk (we used DIY coconut – use creamier milks for creamier, thicker pudding, such as full fat coconut and cashew)
* ½ cup chia seeds
* 1-2 Tbsp maple syrup (more or less to taste)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

### FOR SERVING optional

* Compote
* Mint
* Fresh Fruit

## Directions

* To a mixing bowl add dairy free milk, chia seeds, maple syrup (to taste), and vanilla. Whisk to combine.
* Cover and refrigerate overnight (or at least 6 hours). The chia pudding should be thick and creamy. If not, add more chia seeds, stir, and refrigerate for another hour or so.
* Enjoy as is, or layer with compote or fresh fruit! Will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 5 days.
