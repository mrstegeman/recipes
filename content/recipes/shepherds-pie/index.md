## Ingredients
* 1 ½ lbs ground beef
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 cups frozen vegetables
* 1 ½ - 2 lbs potatoes
* 6 tbsp butter
* 1 cup beef broth
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp ketchup
* salt, pepper, other seasonings to taste

## Directions
* Peel and quarter potatoes. Boil in salted water until tender.
* While potatoes are boiling, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in frying pan. Sauté onions in butter until tender, add in ½ cup of water and vegetables. Cook through, then drain the water.
* In separate frying pan, cook hamburger until brown, adding a little salt and pepper for flavor. Drain hamburger and add to vegetables. Mix together, then add in the Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, ketchup, and beef broth and stir to combine. Add more beef broth if necessary to keep mixture moist, but be careful to not make it too watery. I seasoned the mixture with some garlic powder and oregano -- feel free to add whichever spices you like best here. Cook over low heat for ten minutes.
* Mash potatoes in bowl with the remaining butter. Season to taste.
* Pour meat and vegetable mixture into a 9x13 baking dish. Spread mashed potatoes evenly over the top. Bake for 20 minutes at 375°, until bubbling and brown. Broil for the last few minutes if necessary to brown.
