## Ingredients
* 1 lb extra firm tofu, pressed
* 1/4 cup corn starch or tapioca starch
* 1/4 cup plant milk, unsweetened and unflavored
* 3/4 cup vegan breadcrumbs or panko
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1 tbsp fresh parsley, minced
* 1 tbsp oil, divided
* 1/2 cup hot sauce
* 1/4 cup vegan butter, melted

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Line baking sheet with foil and grease with half the oil.
* Cut pressed tofu into 6 slabs. Cut each slab diagonally.
* Create a dredging station. In one bowl, place starch. Next is plant milk. Final bowl is breadcrumbs, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne, nutritional yeast and parsley. Mix to combine.
* One tofu chunk at a time, cover in starch and shake off excess. Dip into the milk on both sides and coat with breadcrumbs. Place on baking sheet and continue until all tofu is breaded.
* Drizzle or spray the top of the wings with remaining oil. Bake for 35-45 minutes or until crispy, flipping halfway.
* In a large bowl, combine hot sauce, butter and a pinch of salt. Immediately before serving, toss wings in hot sauce. Serve warm.
