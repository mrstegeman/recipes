## Ingredients
* 1 head cabbage, cored and chopped
* 1 medium white onion, chopped
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 2 teaspoons onion powder
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* Salt and pepper to taste
* {'Optional': 'red pepper flakes'}

## Directions
* Prep cabbage and onion.
* Add butter to large skillet over medium high heat. Sauté onion for 3 minutes.
* Add cabbage to skillet and toss/stir often (use tongs to make it easy) until it is as soft as you’d like, about 15 minutes.
* Add in garlic, paprika, onion powder, garlic, powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for a few more minutes. Turn heat down if cabbage browns too quickly. Some browning is good.
* Add red pepper flakes if desired.
