From [Food.com](https://www.food.com/recipe/dump-maple-mustard-chicken-308779).

## Ingredients
* 6 large skinless chicken thighs
* 2 tablespoons grainy French mustard
* 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
* 1 minced garlic clove
* 1⁄2 teaspoon dried marjoram
* 2 tablespoons maple syrup

## Directions
* Rinse chicken and pat dry.
* Combine mustard, garlic, marjoram and maple syrup in a small bowl. Spread about 1 ½ tablespoons mustard mixture evenly on top of each chicken thigh, being careful to cover as much of the surface as possible to form a "crust."
* Arrange chicken in a glass baking dish.
* Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until mustard mixture has formed a crust and is slightly hardened, and juices run clear when the chicken is pierced.
* To Freeze -- Mix all ingredients into a large freezer bag, smoosh around to combine, seal, being sure to squeeze out all the air.
