From [Gimme Some Oven](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/sloppy-joe-tacos/).

## Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 pound lean ground beef
* 1 small yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 1 small red bell pepper, cored and diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 cups tomato sauce
* 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* pinch of salt and pepper, to taste
* Old El Paso Stand ‘n’ Stuff Taco Shells (Traditional Corn or Nacho Cheese)
* optional toppings -- shredded Mexican cheese, chopped fresh cilantro, sour cream, diced avocado, etc.

## Directions
* Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add ground beef and cook until browned, breaking up the beef with a spoon and stirring occasionally.  Drain off any excess fat and discard it.
* Return pan to the heat, and add the onion, red bell pepper and garlic to the ground beef.  Continue sauteing for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft and translucent, stirring occasionally.
* While the veggies are sauteing, whisk together the tomato sauce, brown sugar, worcestershire, and chili powder until combined.  Once the veggies are cooked, add the tomato sauce mixture to the ground beef and stir until combined.  Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, then remove from heat.
* To assemble the tacos, place the ground beef filling in the taco shells and top with your desired toppings.  Serve immediately.
