## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (6.6 ounces; 190g)
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight
* 4 ounces cold unsalted butter (1 stick; 115g), cut into 1/4-inch cubes and refrigerated
* 3/4 cup (180ml) whole milk

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper; alternatively, grease the baking sheet with butter.
* In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
* Toss butter into dry ingredients until coated with flour. Working quickly, using your fingers or a pastry blender, rub or cut butter into flour until it resembles coarse meal. Alternatively, add flour mixture and butter to the bowl of a food processor and pulse 2 to 3 times to form pea-sized pieces; transfer to a large bowl.
* Add milk and stir with a fork until the mixture just comes together into a slightly sticky, shaggy dough.
* For small biscuits, use a teaspoon or a small cookie scoop to mound walnut-sized balls of dough onto prepared baking sheet. For large biscuits, use a 1/4-cup measuring cup to mound balls of dough onto prepared baking sheet.
* Bake biscuits until golden brown, about 15 minutes for small biscuits and 20 minutes for large ones. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
