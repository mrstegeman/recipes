## Ingredients

**For the streusel:**

* ¾ cup all-purpose flour
* ¾ cup granulated sugar
* ½ cup packed dark brown sugar, divided
* 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
* 1 cup pecans, chopped
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces and chilled

**For the cake:**

* 1 ½ cups sour cream, divided
* 4 large eggs
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
* 1 ¼ cups granulated sugar
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* ¾ teaspoon baking soda
* ¾ teaspoon table salt
* 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes and softened

## Directions

**For the streusel:**

* In a food processor combine flour, granulated sugar, ¼ cup brown sugar, and cinnamon for about 15 seconds.
* Transfer 1 ¼ cups flour-sugar mixture to bowl and stir in remaining ¼ cup brown sugar; set aside for filling.
* Add pecans and butter to the food processor and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal, about 10 pulses; set aside for topping.

**For the cake:**

* Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350°.
* Grease and flour bundt pan.
* Whisk 1 cup sour cream, eggs, and vanilla together in a bowl.
* Using a stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt on low speed until combined.
* Add butter and remaining ½ cup sour cream and mix until dry ingredients are moistened and mixture resembles wet sand with few large butter pieces remaining, about 1½ minutes.
* Increase speed to medium and beat until batter comes together, about 10 seconds, scraping down bowl with rubber spatula. Reduce speed to medium-low and gradually add egg mixture in 3 additions, beating for 20 seconds and scraping down bowl after each addition. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until batter is light and fluffy, about 1 minute.
* Spread 2 cups batter in the prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Sprinkle evenly with ¾ cup streusel filling. Repeat with another 2 cups batter and remaining ¾ cup streusel filling. Spread remaining batter over filling, then sprinkle with streusel topping.
* Bake until the cake feels firm and a toothpick or knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour, rotating pan halfway through baking.
* Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes.
* Remove cake from pan and let cool completely on rack, about 2 hours.
* Serve. Cake can be wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at room temperature for up to 5 days.
