## Ingredients
* 4 cups mixed salad greens (spinach, arugula, kale)
* 1 cup pomegranate seeds
* 1 medium butternut squash, peeled and diced
* ½ cup crumbled feta cheese
* ½ cup walnuts, roughly chopped
* ¼ cup red onion, thinly sliced
* ¼ cup olive oil
* 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
* 1 teaspoon honey
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Fresh herbs (optional, for garnish)

## Directions
* Preheat the Oven: Begin by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C).
* Prepare the Butternut Squash: Peel and dice the butternut squash into small cubes. Spread them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
* Season the Squash: Drizzle olive oil over the squash, and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat evenly.
* Roast the Squash: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and roast the squash for about 25–30 minutes or until tender and golden brown.
* Prepare the Salad Base: While the squash is roasting, wash and dry the mixed salad greens. Place them in a large salad bowl.
* Add Other Ingredients: To the greens, add the pomegranate seeds, crumbled feta cheese, walnuts, and sliced red onion.
* Make the Dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, balsamic vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper to create a dressing.
* Combine Salad and Dressing: Once the squash is done roasting and has cooled slightly, add it to the salad bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the top.
* Toss to Combine: Gently toss all the ingredients together until well mixed.
* Garnish and Serve: If desired, sprinkle fresh herbs on top for an added touch of color and flavor.
