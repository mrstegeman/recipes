## Ingredients

* Cooking spray

### For the Cake

* 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more for the pan
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup sour cream
* 1 1/2 pounds medium apples, such as Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or Pink Lady (3 apples)
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 cup whole or 2% milk
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1 cup packed light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt

### For the Streusel Topping

* 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon grated or ground nutmeg
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

## Directions

* Cut 12 tablespoons unsalted butter into small cubes, then place in a stand mixer and let sit at room temperature to soften. (Alternatively, place in a large bowl if using an electric hand mixer.) Meanwhile, arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with butter. Place 2 large eggs and 1 cup sour cream at room temperature while you prepare the streusel and cut the apples. Prepare the streusel.
* **Make the streusel.** Place 8 tablespoons unsalted butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 20-second bursts until completely melted, 50 to 60 seconds total. (Alternatively, melt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.)
* Add 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon grated or ground nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to the melted butter and stir until combined and the salt is melted. Add1 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, and 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar and stir with a fork until evenly moistened and a variety of crumb sizes form. Do not mix into a paste of uniform consistency. Refrigerate until the butter firms up, at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the cake.
* **Make the cake.** Peel and dice 1 1/2 pounds Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or Pink Lady apples (about 3 2/3 cups).
* Place 3 cups all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda in a large bowl and whisk to combine.
* Add the eggs, sour cream, 1/2 cup milk, and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract to a medium bowl and whisk to combine.
* Add 1 cup granulated sugar, 1 cup packed light brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt to the butter in the stand mixer. Beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed until lightened in color fluffy, about 7 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. With the mixer on low speed, add half of the flour mixture and beat until mostly incorporated. Add the milk mixture and beat until just combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.
* Return the mixer to low speed, add the remaining flour mixture, and beat until just combined. Stop the mixer, add the apples, and fold in by hand with a flexible spatula.
* Transfer the batter to the prepared baking pan and smooth the top. Crumble the chilled streusel evenly over the top.
* Bake until the cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 58 to 63 minutes. Place the pan on a wire rack and cool completely, about 3 hours. Cut into squares and serve straight from the pan.
