## Ingredients
* 12 ounces fettuccine noodles
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons honey
* 2 teaspoons chili paste
* 1 clove garlic minced
* 1/2 teaspoon dried ginger
* 1 pound bacon
* 1/2 sweet onion
* 8 ounces frozen peas and carrots
* 2 large eggs
* 1/4 cup chopped green onions

## Directions
* Add the fettucine to a large pot of boiling water and cook until al dente. Drain.
* Prepare the sauce by mixing together the soy sauce, honey, chili paste, garlic, and ginger. Set aside.
* While fettucine is cooking, dice the bacon and onion.
* Cook the bacon over medium high heat until cooked through, but not crisp. Drain the grease, leaving 2 tablespoons behind in the pan.
* Return the pan to heat and add the onion to the bacon and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often.
* Stir in the peas and carrots and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring often.
* Push the bacon and vegetables to the side of the pan and crack the eggs in. Stir constantly to scramble the eggs.
