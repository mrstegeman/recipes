From [Seasons & Suppers](https://www.seasonsandsuppers.ca/dill-pickle-soup/).

## Ingredients
* 2 Tablespoon butter
* ½ cup onion, diced, about 1 med onion
* 1 cup carrot, grated, well packed, about 1 large carrot
* 3 cups russet baking potatoes, peeled and chopped
* ½ teaspoon fine salt
* ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
* 3-4 Tablespoon dill pickle brining liquid, from the jar
* ½ cup full-fat sour cream, at room temperature
* 2 Tablespoon all-purpose flour
* ⅓ cup dill pickles, grated
* ½ Tablespoon fresh dill, chopped

Garnish Options:
* ¼ cup dill pickle, finely diced
* ½ Tablespoon fresh dill
* Dollop of sour cream

## Directions
* Take the sour cream out of the fridge before you start, so that it will come to room temperature before it is added to the soup.
* In a large pot over medium heat, melt the butter, then add the onions and carrot. Sauté for about 4-5 minutes or until softened. Add the potatoes ½ tsp each salt and the ¼ tsp pepper. Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.
* Add the broth and dill pickle liquid. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently, for about 20-30 minutes or until potatoes are very soft (time will depend on how small or large the potatoes were chopped).
* Use an immersion blender in the pot to purée about half the soup, leaving some chunks (or transfer about half the soup in batches to a blender and purée until smooth, then return to the pot).
* In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and flour. Drizzle in about 1 Tbsp of the warm soup and whisk in (to warm the sour cream mixture a bit). Gradually add dollops of the sour cream mixture into the soup, whisking really well after each addition until blended, until all the sour cream mixture has been added. Stir in the shredded pickles. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, for 5 to 10 minutes or until warmed and slightly thickened. Stir inthe fresh dill. Taste the soup and and season to taste with additional salt and pepper.
* Serve soup with additional fresh dill for garnish, some diced dill pickles and/or a dollop of sour cream.

## Notes
* Grate the carrot and dill pickles with a box grater.
* If you don't have fresh dill on hand, you can use dried dill. Use about ⅓ of the amount specified for dried dill.
* Refrigerate leftovers up to 3 days or freeze up to 3 months.
