From [POPSUGAR](https://www.popsugar.com/food/Recipe-Bacon-Wrapped-Dates-4952556).

## Ingredients
* 16-ounce package of bacon (regular thickness, not thick cut), cut into thirds
* 8-ounce package of pitted dates

## Directions
* Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Position oven rack in the center of the oven. Cover a cookie sheet with tin foil.
* Wrap a piece of bacon around a date. Make sure the bacon seam is placed facing downward on the cookie sheet. Press firmly on the bacon-wrapped date, so it is less likely to unravel. Repeat until all of the dates are wrapped in bacon.
* Bake for 20-25 minutes until crisp. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before serving.
