## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups water
* 3 tablespoons white vinegar or apple cider vinegar
* 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher or pickling salt*
* 2 teaspoons black peppercorns
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled
* 6 large sprigs fresh dill
* 1 bay leaf
* (optional) 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more/less to taste
* 1 large English hothouse seedless cucumber, sliced into rounds or spears

## Directions
* Add the water, vinegar, salt, peppercorns, garlic, dill and bay leaf to a large (1-quart) jar — or divide the mixture evenly between two small (1-pint) jars — and stir to combine.
* Add the sliced cucumbers to the jar(s).  Then place the lids on the jar(s), and shake to combine.
* Refrigerate ideally for at least 2 days before eating, although you can totally dive in before that time.  The pickles will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
