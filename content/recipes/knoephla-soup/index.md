* **NOTE:** Using homemade chicken stock will give the best results, but boxed works well, as well.
* If you are running short on time, you can shorten the cooking process by not rolling out the dough and using a spoon to quickly make the dumplings. I recommend rolling, but I do this shortcut occasionally.
* Frozen dumplings would be fine for saving time, but homemade is better!
