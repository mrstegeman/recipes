From [Gimme Some Oven](http://www.gimmesomeoven.com/quick-pickled-red-onions/).

## Ingredients
* 1 large red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced
* 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1â€“2 tablespoons sweetener (such as maple syrup, honey, sugar, etc.)

## Directions
* In a small saucepan, stir together the vinegar, salt and your desired amount of sweetener. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches a simmer.
* Place the thinly-sliced onions in a small bowl or pint-sized mason jar. Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the onions. Stir until combined. (Or if using a mason jar, place the lid on top and give the jar a quick shake.) Let the onions marinate for 30 minutes.
* Serve immediately. Or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 2 weeks.
