## Ingredients
* 10 cups Pamela's Artisan Flour
* 8 tablespoons baking powder
* 4 teaspoons sugar
* 4 teaspoons salt
* 4 cups milk
* 8 teaspoons cream of tartar
* 32 tablespoons cold butter

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 425. Sift flour, baking powder, sugar and salt into a large mixing bowl. Transfer to a food processor. Cut frozen butter into cubes and add to flour, then pulse 6 or 7 times until it looks like a loose crumble.  Place the dough back in the bowl, add buttermilk and stir with a spatula until it forms a rough ball (donâ€™t worry if it is a little sticky).
* Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll it into a rough rectangle, about an inch thick. Fold it over and gently roll it down again. Repeat 6 times.
* Gently roll out the dough once more, so that it forms a rectangle. Cut dough into biscuits using a floured glass or biscuit cutter. Do not twist cutter when cutting; this will crimp the edges of the biscuit causing it not to rise. If you have scraps just reform a rectangle and cut additional biscuits.
* Place biscuits on a baking sheet and place in oven. Make sure they're touching. Bake until golden brown, approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Serves 6 to 8. Brush on the melted butter and enjoy!
* NOTE -- If you don't have a food processor, you can cut butter into flour in the mixing bowl using a grater, fork or a pastry cutter.
