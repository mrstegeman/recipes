And that’s it! Consider getting creative and including tasty surprises like grated carrots or sweet potatoes, parsley, blueberries, bananas, etc. — whatever non-toxic fruits or veggies your dog likes.

Also, this recipe makes a lot and lasts for a few weeks. If the amount is too much for your dog to consume within that time, consider halving the recipe or freezing the dough/treats for later!

\*_A note on the flour: if you’d rather create a grain-free version, you can substitute the flours listed for bean flour (like chickpea flour/gram flour) or even buckwheat (which isn’t actually a grain and is gluten-free). Other options are quinoa flour, coconut flour, and even peanut flour — or a mixture of any of these!_

\*\*_A note on the baby food: Most baby foods do not contain these ingredients anyway, but it’s good to note that you should avoid using any that contain onions, grapes, or raisins. Unsure? Check this list of possibly toxic foods from ASPCA._

## Ingredients
* 2 cups 100% organic whole wheat flour* (or wheat germ, spelt, rolled oats — or a mixture of these)
* 2 (4oz) jars of pureed baby food** – beef, blueberry, sweet potato, chicken, etc.

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 350°.
* Mix ingredients together to form a stiff dough. If necessary, add extra flour or water as needed.
* On a lightly floured surface, roll dough out evenly until it’s about 1/4 inch thick. Use cookie cutters to cut into desired shape or a pizza cutter to make cubes.
* Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper, place treats about 1/2 inch apart. Bake for 20 – 25 minutes.
* Allow to cool completely before storing in a paper bag (storing in an air-tight container will make them soft, but they’re still edible).
