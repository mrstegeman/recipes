From [House of Yumm](https://houseofyumm.com/chicken-tacos/).

## Ingredients
* 2 teaspoons chili powder
* ½ teaspoon paprika
* 1 ½ teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* ½ teaspoon cumin
* ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
* ½ teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1 cup no sodium chicken broth

## Directions
* In a small bowl combine all of the ingredients to make the chicken taco seasoning. Stir to combine.
* Coat the chicken on both sides with the chicken taco seasoning.
* Drizzle the olive oil and heat in a large skillet over medium heat.
* Add the chicken and let it cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side. Pour in the chicken stock. Cover the skillet and let the chicken cook in the broth for about 15-20 minutes, until the chicken registers 165° internally and is cooked through.
* Remove the chicken from the skillet, shred using a fork, then return to the skillet. Stir to coat the chicken in the remaining sauce in the skillet. Let sit and keep warm on low heat for about 3-5 minutes, to get good flavor throughout the chicken.
* Serve warm on tortillas with any additional toppings you would enjoy!
