## Ingredients
* (cranberry layer) 3 ½ cups fresh cranberries
* (cranberry layer) ⅔ cup sugar
* (cranberry layer) 2 tablespoons water
* (crust and topping) 3 cups all-purpose flour
* (crust and topping) 1 cups sugar
* (crust and topping) ½ teaspoon salt
* (crust and topping) ¾ cup unsalted butter melted
* (filling) 3 large eggs
* (filling) ⅓ cup half and half
* (filling) 1 cup brown sugar
* (filling) 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* (filling) 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* (filling) ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
* (filling) pinch of salt

## Directions
* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with nonstick spray.
* Make the cranberry filling first. Heat the cranberries, sugar and water together in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer, stirring often, until the berries begin to burst, the sugar melts and the mixture thickens, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the heat and let cool to room temperature.
* For the crust and topping -- Stir the flour, sugar and salt together in a large bowl. Add the melted butter and stir until a shortbread-like dough comes together. I even use my hands to bring it together. Press half of the dough into the bottom of the dish.
* For the filling -- In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, half and half, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt and cornstarch. Gently fold in in the cranberry filling.
* Pour the mixture over top of the crust. Crumble the rest of the dough over top of the cranberry mixture. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until the bars are set and no long jiggly. Cool completely (thi is important! You can even cool overnight.) before slicing into squares!
