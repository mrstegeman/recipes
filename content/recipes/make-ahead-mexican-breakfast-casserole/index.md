## Ingredients
* 12 eggs, whisked
* 1/2 medium onion, diced
* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 sweet potato, shredded with skin on
* 1 jalapeno, deseeded and chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 cups diced fresh tomatoes (or 1 can of diced tomatoes, drained)
* 2 cups fresh spinach (or chard or any leafy green you choose)

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 375 F. Spray a 9"X13" baking dish with nonstick spray and set aside.
* Whisk eggs in a medium bowl and set aside.
* Shred sweet potato using a food processor with shredding attachment or by hand. Set aside.
* Cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Break into crumbly pieces using a spatula. Drain off extra grease. Add onion, shredded sweet potato, garlic, jalape√±o, chili powder, salt, and paprika into skillet. Cook until onions are translucent (about 5 to 7 minutes).  Add tomatoes and spinach into skillet and cook for about 2 minutes or until spinach begins to wilt.
* Pour beef and sweet potato mixture into the prepared 9"X13" pan and spread evenly along the bottom. Pour whisked eggs over the top, making sure to mix the eggs into the sweet potato mixture with a spoon or spatula. (The casserole can be made ahead 1 day in advance up to this point and covered and refrigerated. Remove from fridge 15 minutes before cooking.)
* Place in preheated oven and bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until middle of casserole is set (not jiggly) and edges are lightly browned. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Feeds a crowd of 8 to 10 or it feeds 2 people over the course of a week!!!!
