## Ingredients
* 4 tuna steaks (6 ounces each)
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon pepper
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme or ½ teaspoon dried thyme

## Directions
* In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the lemon juice, oil, garlic and thyme. Add the tuna; seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for up to 30 minutes, turning occasionally.
* Remove tuna from bag; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drain and discard marinade. Moisten a paper towel with cooking oil; using long-handled tongs, lightly coat the grill rack.
* Grill tuna, covered, over medium-hot heat or broil 4 in. from the heat for 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare or until slightly pink in the center.
