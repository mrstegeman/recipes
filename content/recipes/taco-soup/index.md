Adapted from [Paula Deen's recipe](https://www.food.com/recipe/taco-soup-paula-deen-111231).

## Ingredients
* 4 cups chicken broth
* 2 lbs ground beef or chicken
* 2 cups diced onions
* 2 (15 1/2 oz) cans pinto beans
* 1 (15 1/2 oz) can pink kidney beans
* 2 cups frozen corn
* 1 (14 1/2 oz) can Mexican-style stewed tomatoes
* 3 (14 1/2 oz) cans diced tomatoes
* 2 (4 1/2 oz) cans diced green chiles
* 2 (4.6 oz) can black olives, drained and sliced
* (taco seasoning) 2 tsp chili powder
* (taco seasoning) 2 tsp paprika
* (taco seasoning) 1 tsp onion powder
* (taco seasoning) 1/2 tsp salt
* (taco seasoning) 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* (taco seasoning) 1/2 tsp cumin
* (taco seasoning) 1/2 tsp oregano
* (taco seasoning) 1/4 tsp black pepper
* (ranch seasoning) 2 tbsp parsley
* (ranch seasoning) 1 1/2 tsp dill
* (ranch seasoning) 2 tsp garlic powder
* (ranch seasoning) 2 tsp dried onion flakes
* (ranch seasoning) 1 tsp black pepper
* (ranch seasoning) 1 tsp dried chives
* (ranch seasoning) 1 tsp salt
* Corn chips, for serving
* Chopped green onions, for garnish
* Pickled jalapeños, for garnish

## Directions
* Brown the ground beef and onions in a large skillet; drain off excess fat and transfer browned beef and onions to a large slow cooker or stockpot.
* Add the beans, corn, tomatoes (I like to mash all of the tomato products before I put them in the stockpot -- sometimes there are very large chunks of tomatoes, especially in the stewed tomatoes), green chilies, black olives, green olives, taco seasoning and ranch dressing mix.
* Simmer over low heat for about 1 hour (or 6-8 hours on low setting in crock pot).
* To serve, place a few corn chips in each bowl and ladle soup over them.
* Top with green onions and jalapeños.
