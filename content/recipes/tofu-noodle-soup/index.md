## Ingredients
* 1 14-oz. block extra-firm tofu drained and pressed
* 1 and 1/2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp coconut oil
* 1 cup diced onion
* 1 cup diced celery
* 1 cup sliced carrot (peeled if desired)
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1/4 tsp dried thyme
* 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
* 1/8 tsp ground white pepper (or additional black pepper)
* 8 cups vegan chicken-style broth (or use any vegetable broth or stock)
* 2 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
* 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
* 8 oz. brown rice elbows (scant 2 cups) (or pasta of choice, broken into bite-sized pieces if applicable)
* salt to taste (I used 1/2 tsp; add it gradually)

## Directions
* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Open the tofu package, drain the excess liquid, and press the tofu while the oven reheats. (Either use a tofu press, or wrap the tofu in a clean towel and stack something heavy on top of it).
* Press down on the tofu to "squish" it up into more irregular shape, then roughly chop it. (Optional; feel free to just cube it if you prefer). Place the tofu pieces on the baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes, then agitate and flip the tofu pieces. Bake for another 15-25 minutes, or until the tofu pieces have firmed up significantly, with a slightly crisped crust on the outside. Remove from the oven and set aside.
* (I start this step when the tofu has about 10 minutes left in the oven). In a large saucepan, heat the oils over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, and carrot, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally. If the vegetables start to brown, turn down the heat to medium-low. Continue until the onions and celery are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
* Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, thyme, black pepper and white pepper and stir. Cook until fragrant, 60 to 90 seconds. Add the broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and stir in the soy sauce, nutritional yeast, pasta, and baked tofu pieces. Continue to cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, or until the pasta is tender.
* Season to taste with additional salt and pepper. Serve topped with fresh thyme or parsley, if desired.
