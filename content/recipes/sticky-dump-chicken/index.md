From [Recipe Goldmine](https://recipegoldmine.com/meatchickdump/sticky-dump-chicken.html).

## Ingredients
* 3 chicken breasts or 6 thighs
* 2 tablespoons vegetable or extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 3 tablespoons smooth peanut butter
* 3 tablespoons ketchup

## Directions
* For freezing -- Place all ingredients into a 1-gallon freezer bag, mixing well. Lay flat in freezer.
* For thawing -- Take the bag out of the freezer the night before, making sure the freezer bag is completely sealed. Place the bag on a shelf in the refrigerator furthest from the freezer (it works best if the bag is laying flat, although this may not be the best option with a side-by-side refrigerator/freezer).
* For baking -- Heat oven to 350°F. Place all ingredients into a large baking dish, turn chicken to coat. Bake until chicken juices run clear (about 30 to 60 minutes depending upon the chicken pieces used).
* For the slow cooker -- Using tongs, put chicken in the bottom of the pot. Pour remaining ingredients over the chicken. Cook on LOW for 6-8 hours or on HIGH for 4-6 hours or until done.
