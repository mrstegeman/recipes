From [Sally's Baking Addiction](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/bourbon-cherry-crisp/).

## Ingredients
* 5 cups halved pitted cherries
* 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
* 3 Tablespoons (21g) cornstarch
* 2–3 Tablespoons (30-45ml) bourbon
* 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

## Topping
* 1/2 cup (100g) packed light or dark brown sugar
* 6 Tablespoons (46g) all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, very cold and cubed
* 2/3 cup (57g) old-fashioned whole rolled oats
* optional: handful of slivered/chopped/sliced almonds

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Lightly grease a 9-inch round or 9-inch square baking dish (or similar size).
* Mix all of the filling ingredients together in a large bowl, then spread into the baking dish.
* Make the topping: Whisk the brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Cut in the butter using a pastry cutter or fork until the mixture is crumbly. See photo above for a visual. Fold in the oats and almonds. Sprinkle evenly over filling.
* Bake for 40-45 minutes until the topping is golden brown and the fruit juices are bubbling around the edges. Remove from the oven, place on a wire rack, and allow to cool for a few minutes before serving warm. You can also serve room temperature or cold.
* Cover leftovers and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

## Notes

* Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Baked crisp freezes well for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then warm in a 350°F (177°C) for 20 minutes or until heated through. I do not suggest preparing the crisp and storing it, unbaked, in the refrigerator because the topping will get soggy. You can prepare and assemble the crisp through step 3 and freeze for up to 3 months. Allow to thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then continue with step 4.
* Cherries: You need about 1.5 lbs of cherries. You can use any variety—I use a combination of dark sweet and rainier. If using sour cherries, increase sugar to 3/4 depending how sweet you like it. You can use frozen cherries. Thaw and blot them with a paper towel before using.
* Bourbon: I’m not much of a bourbon connoisseur. Since the bourbon is being used in a recipe and you only need a couple Tablespoons, no need to purchase the fancy stuff. I used Jim Beam. I tested the recipe with 2 Tablespoons and 3 Tablespoons. Anywhere around either amount is great. If you’d rather skip the alcohol, use 2 Tablespoons of orange juice or 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice instead.
