From [Gimme Some Oven](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/apple-cider-mezcal-margarita/).

## Ingredients
* 2 ounces mezcal
* 2 ounces apple cider, homemade or store-bought
* 1 ounce freshly-squeezed lime juice
* optional sweetener -- maple syrup or agave nectar, to taste*
* ice
* optional garnishes -- diced apples and a cinnamon stick
* (sweet ginger rim garnish) 1 tablespoon coarse Kosher salt
* (sweet ginger rim garnish) 1 tablespoon granulated or brown sugar
* (sweet ginger rim garnish) 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* (sweet ginger rim garnish) 1 lime

## Directions
* Begin by salting the rims of your glasses, if you would like.  (See instructions below.)
* Add mezcal, apple cider, and lime juice to a cocktail shaker, and shake or stir until combined.  Taste, and if you would like the mixture to be sweeter, stir in a half teaspoon of maple syrup or agave nectar at a time, until the mix reaches your desired level of sweetness.
* Fill glass with ice.  Pour in the margarita mixture over the rocks.  Serve immediately, garnished with diced apples and a cinnamon stick, if desired.
* TO MAKE THE SWEET GINGER SALT RIM GARNISH -- Whisk together the salt, sugar and ground ginger in a shallow bowl until combined.  Run a slice of lime (the juicy part!) around the top edge of your glass, then dip it in the ginger mixture.
