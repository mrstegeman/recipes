\*For gluten-free flours, we like Bob’s Red Mill Gluten-free 1 to 1 flour or King Arthur Flour Measure to Measure

\*\*If adding zucchini, we recommend removing as much liquid as possible by placing the zucchini shreds on a double layer of paper towel and pressing out the liquid. It doesn’t all need to be absorbed but just enough to remove some of the liquid before adding to the dough.

Store muffins in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 7 days. To reheat, pop in the microwave for 20 seconds.

May also store in the freezer for up to 3 months.
