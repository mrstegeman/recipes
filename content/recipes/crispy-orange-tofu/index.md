## Ingredients
* (tofu marinade) 2 blocks Firm Tofu - 14 oz, 400g each
* (tofu marinade) 4 tablespoons Olive Oil
* (tofu marinade) 4 tablespoons Cornstarch
* (tofu marinade) 1/2 teaspoon Garlic Powder
* (tofu marinade) 3 tablespoons Orange Zest - from 1 orange
* (tofu marinade) 1/2 teaspoon Salt
* (orange sauce) 1 tablespoon Coconut Oil
* (orange sauce) 3 Garlic Cloves - crushed or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* (orange sauce) 1/4 teaspoon Ground Ginger - or 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger
* (orange sauce) 1 cup Fresh Orange Juice
* (orange sauce) 1/3 cup Soft Brown Sugar - up to 1/2 cup if you love it very sweet
* (orange sauce) 1/4 cup Soy Sauce
* (orange sauce) 1/4 cup Rice Vinegar
* (orange sauce) 2 tablespoons Corn Starch
* (orange sauce) 2-3 tablespoons Cold Water
* (to serve) 1 cup Jasmine Rice
* (to serve) 2 tablespoons Scallions - finely chopped
* (to serve) 1 pinch Chili Flakes

## Directions
* Wrap the tofu block with absorbent paper and place it between two chopping boards, adding a few books on top of the top board to add pressure. Set aside 30 minutes to release all the tofu moisture.
* Cut the tofu block into cubes of (about 0.4 inches/1cm) or roughly pull apart the tofu to create irregular pieces of tofu – this mimics chicken texture the best!
* Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Set aside.
* In a large mixing bowl, combine all the marinade ingredients -- olive oil, cornstarch, garlic powder, orange zest, and salt.
* Add the tofu chunks into the marinade and combine with a spoon.
* Lay the tofu pieces onto the prepared baking sheet into a single layer, make sure the tofu pieces don't touch each other or overlap.
* Bake on the center rack for 20-30 minutes, flipping them halfway. Meanwhile, prepare the curry sauce.
* Heat a large skillet or medium saucepan over medium-high heat.
* Over medium heat, melt coconut oil, then stir in garlic, ginger, and cook over low heat to prevent the garlic from burning. Cook until fragrant for about 1 minute.
* Add orange juice, brown sugar, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. Bring to a light simmer, occasionally stirring, until the sugar dissolves – about 2-3 minutes.
* Meanwhile, whisk water and cornstarch in a small mixing bowl. Whisk in the cornstarch slurry into the hot orange sauce and keep simmering, occasionally stirring, until the sauce thickens – about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat.
* Toss the crispy hot tofu in the sauce until coated.
* Serve over cooked jasmine rice and garnish with scallions pieces or chili flakes to add a spicy touch.
* Store in the fridge in a sealed container for 3-4 days or freeze up to 3 months.
