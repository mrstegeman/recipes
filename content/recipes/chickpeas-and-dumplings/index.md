## Ingredients
* (soup) 6 tablespoon unsalted butter
* (soup) 2 small sweet onions, diced
* (soup) 4 medium carrots, peeled and diced
* (soup) 4 celery stalks, diced
* (soup) 4 garlic cloves, minced
* (soup) kosher salt and pepper
* (soup) 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
* (soup) 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
* (soup) 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* (soup) 8 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock
* (soup) 2 15 ounce cans of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* (soup) 1/2 cup heavy cream
* (soup) chopped fresh parsley, for topping
* (dumplings) 2 cups all-purpose flour
* (dumplings) 4 teaspoons baking powder
* (dumplings) 1 teaspoon salt
* (dumplings) 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning (or herbes de provence)
* (dumplings) 2 large eggs lightly beaten
* (dumplings) 1 cup buttermilk

## Directions
* Melt the butter in a pot over medium-low heat. Once melted, stir in the onion, carrots, celery and garlic with a big pinch of salt and pepper. Stir in the rosemary and thyme. Cook until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes.
* While the veggies soften, make the dumplings. Whisk together the 1 cup of flour, baking powder, salt and poultry seasoning in a large bowl. Combine the milk and the eggs, then stir into the flour until just mixed. Set aside for a few minutes.
* Stir the 6 tablespoons of flour into the pan, coating the vegetables to create a roux. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, making sure it doesnâ€™t burn. Slowly stream in 8 cups of the stock, stirring while doing so. Cook for another 5 minutes, letting the mixture come to a low boil - it should thicken a bit.
* Stir in the chickpeas. Stir in the cream. You want the mixture to be lightly bubbling over medium heat. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed.
* Take the dumpling batter and drop spoonfuls of it into the soup. Cook for 7 minutes, then flip the dumplings and cook them for 7 minutes more. If the mixture comes to a full boil, decrease the heat while simmering the dumplings.
* Sprinkle with parsley and serve!
