## Ingredients
* 2/3 cup sugar (white)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 2 1/2 cups almond milk (unsweetened, or other non-dairy milk alternatives)
* 4 large egg yolks
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions
* Gather the ingredients.
* In a small saucepan, whisk together the sugar and salt.
* In a small dish, combine the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of the almond milk, mixing until dissolved.
* Add the cornstarch mixture, remaining almond milk, and egg yolks to the saucepan, whisking until combined.
* Cook the pudding over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and bubbles just begin to form on the surface.
* Whisking constantly, turn down the heat to low and cook for about 1 minute more.
* Pour the pudding through a fine sieve into a heatproof dish and stir in the vanilla extract.
* Place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding and chill at least 2 hours before serving. This will prevent a skin from forming while the pudding cools and thickens.
* Serve and enjoy!
