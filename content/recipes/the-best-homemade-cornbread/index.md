## Ingredients
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 cup yellow cornmeal
* 2/3 cup granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/3 cup neutral oil or melted butter
* 1 large egg
* 1 cup milk

## Directions
* Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or cast iron skillet well and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
* In a medium mixing bowl, add the flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Whisk to combine well.
* Make a well in the center of your dry ingredients and add your oil or butter, milk, and egg. Stir just until the mixture comes together and there are only a few lumps remaining.
* Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 20-25 minutes until the top is a deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
* Serve hot.
