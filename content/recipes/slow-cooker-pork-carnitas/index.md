## Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* 2 teaspoons salt, or more, to taste
* 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 4 pound pork shoulder, excess fat trimmed
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled
* 2 onions, quartered
* 2 oranges, juiced
* 2 limes, juiced

## Directions
* In a small bowl, combine chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt and pepper. Season pork shoulder with spice mixture, rubbing in thoroughly on all sides.
* Place garlic, onions, orange juice, lime juice and seasoned pork shoulder into a slow cooker. Cover and cook on low heat for 8 hours or high for 4-5 hours.
* Remove pork shoulder from the slow cooker and shred the meat before returning to the pot with the juices; season with salt and pepper, to taste, if needed. Cover and keep warm for an additional 30 minutes.
* Preheat oven to broil. Place carnitas onto a baking sheet and broil until crisp and crusted, about 3-4 minutes.
* Serve immediately.
