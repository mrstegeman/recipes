**Self-Rising Bread Flour:** In a medium bowl, whisk together 2 cups bread flour, 1 tablespoon baking powder, and ½ teaspoon salt.

From [GoDairyFree](https://www.godairyfree.org/recipes/dairy-free-two-ingredient-bagels).

## Ingredients
* 2 cups self-rising bread flour (see below)
* 1 to 2 cups thick dairy-free yogurt (We used two cups of DAH! plain yogurt)
* (topping) 1 large egg or 3 tablespoons aquafaba (for egg-free and vegan)
* (topping) Pinch of salt
* (topping) 1 teaspoon water
* (topping) Everything bagel seasoning mix, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, etc (optional; we used Aldi Everything Bagel Seasoning)

## Directions
* Preheat your oven to 375°F.
* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and spray the paper with baking spray.
* In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the self-rising flour and 1 cup of the dairy-free yogurt. (This process can also be done by hand.)
* Using a dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms.
* Add additional yogurt until you have a good consistency that is not quite sticky. Katherine needed to add another cup of yogurt to reach the desired consistency.
* Increase the speed to medium, and knead until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl and is smooth and elastic.
* Divide the dough into 8 equal portions.
* Shape each portion of dough into a ball. Use your thumb to make a hole in the center of each ball. Gently pull and stretch until the dough is a bagel-shaped ring. Repeat with remaining balls of dough, flouring your hands as needed.
* Arrange the bagels on the prepared baking sheet.
* In a small bowl, whisk together the egg or aquafaba, salt, and water. Brush the egg wash mixture over the bagels. Sprinkle toppings on the bagels, if desired.
* Bake the bagels for 20 to 22 minutes, rotating the baking sheet midway through baking.
* Remove the bagels from the oven. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees.
* Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until the tops of the bagels have browned.
* Serve the bagels immediately, or let them cool and store in an airtight container for up to a day. Freeze for longer keeping.
