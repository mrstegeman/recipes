## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 large yellow or white onions, chopped into ¾-inch pieces (about 3 cups)
* 3 medium carrots, sliced lengthwise and cut into ¾-inch pieces (about 2¼ cups)
* 3 ribs celery, cut into ¾-inch pieces (about 1 cup)
* 2 medium portobello mushrooms, cut into ¾-inch pieces (about 4 cups)
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 lb. white potatoes, peeled and cut into ¾-inch chunks (about 6 cups)
* 1/3 cup no-salt-added tomato paste
* 1 tablespoon dried Italian seasoning
* 1 tablespoon paprika
* 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
* 1 1/2 cups thawed frozen peas
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley

## Directions
* In a Dutch oven or soup pot, cook onions, carrots, and celery with 1 tablespoon water over medium-high heat for 8 minutes, stirring frequently and adding water, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, as needed to prevent sticking. Stir in mushrooms and garlic; cook 5 minutes more, stirring frequently and adding water as needed.
* Stir in potatoes, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, and paprika. Add 5 cups of water. Bring to boiling; reduce heat to medium-low. Stir in rosemary. Cook, covered, 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in peas; cook, covered, 5 minutes more or until carrots and potatoes are tender.
* Transfer 2 cups of the mixture to a blender. Cover and blend until smooth. Return to soup pot. Stir in parsley.
