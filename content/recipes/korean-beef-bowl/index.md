## Ingredients
* 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
* 1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red-pepper flakes, or more to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 pound ground beef
* 2 green onions, thinly sliced
* 1/4 teaspoon sesame seeds

## Directions
* In a small bowl, whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes and ginger.
* Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; drain excess fat.
* Stir in soy sauce mixture and green onions until well combined, allowing to simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.
* Serve immediately, garnished with green onion and sesame seeds, if desired.
