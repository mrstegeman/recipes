From [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/make-tahini-dressing/).

## Ingredients
* 1/3 cup tahini (ground sesame seeds – I love Alexis brand! For other brands, see our tahini review)
* 1 medium lemon, juiced (1 medium lemon yields ~3 Tbsp or 45 ml)
* 1-2 Tbsp maple syrup (or sub agave – or honey if not vegan)
* 1 pinch sea salt (optional)
* 1 clove garlic (minced // optional)
* Water (to thin // ~3-6 Tbsp or 45-90 ml as original recipe is written)

## Directions
* To a medium mixing bowl, add tahini, lemon juice, and maple syrup. If adding salt and garlic, add now (optional).
* Whisk to combine. Then slowly add water until creamy and pourable. The mixture may seize up and thicken at first, but continue adding water a little at a time and whisking until creamy and smooth.
* Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon juice for acidity, salt for saltiness, or maple syrup for sweetness.
* Enjoy fresh, or store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 5 days (sometimes longer). This is delicious on things like Salads, Falafel, Fritters, Buddha Bowls, and more!
