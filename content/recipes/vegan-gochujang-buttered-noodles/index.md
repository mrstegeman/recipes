## Ingredients
* 2 tbsp gochujang Korean red pepper paste
* 2 servings noodles dry (170g), spaghetti or any other noodles of choice
* 3 tbsp vegan butter
* 6 cloves garlic minced
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp maple syrup or agave nectar
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 2 stalks green onions finely chopped (optional)
* 1/2 tbsp sesame seeds (optional)

## Directions
* To start making your gochujang buttered noodles, cook your noodles or pasta according to package instructions. Save around 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water before draining the noodles.
* While noodles cook, melt 2 tbsp vegan butter over medium-low in a non-stick pan. Add minced garlic and season with salt. Cook and stir occasionally until garlic starts to soften but not brown (around 1-3 minutes).
* Stir in the gochujang, maple syrup (or agave nectar) and rice vinegar and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Stir constantly and cook until mixture comes together and reduces (around 3-4 minutes).
* Once noodles are done cooking, remember to save around 1/2 cup of the pasta water and drain the rest. Add the cooked noodles straight into the pan with the buttery gochujang sauce and stir to combine. Voila! Add salt and pepper to taste.
* Before serving, you can optionally top your buttered gochujang noodles with chopped green onions and sesame seeds (optional).
