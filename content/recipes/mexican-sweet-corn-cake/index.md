## Ingredients
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1/3 cup masa (corn flour)
* 1/4 cup water
* 1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen corn (thawed, if frozen)
* 1/4 cup cornmeal
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 2 tablespoons milk
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Directions
* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
* In a large bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Add the masa and water, and beat until incorporated. Set aside.
* Pulse the corn in the food processor. Leave the corn chunky! Stir the corn into the butter mixture.
* In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the milk, and stir to combine.
* Stir the corn meal mixture into the butter-corn mixture just until incorporated. Pour into an ungreased 8×8" baking pan.
* Place the baking pan into a 13×9" baking dish with water filled up 1/3 of the way full. Cover the corn cake with foil.
* Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 50-60 minutes. Cool 10 minutes, then use an ice cream or cookie scoop for serving.
