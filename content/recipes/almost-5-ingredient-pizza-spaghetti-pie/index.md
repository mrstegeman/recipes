## Ingredients
* 1 large spaghetti squash (about 600 grams)
* 1 pound italian sausage
* 1/2 yellow onion, diced
* 1 cup pizza sauce (no sugar added)
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* salt and pepper, to taste
* 3 eggs, whisked
* (optional -- add anything you like with pizza, e.g. veggies, basil, even cheese if you do primal)

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
* Cut spaghetti squash in half lengthwise. Place spaghetti squash cut side down on a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the skin of the squash gives when you press on it. Then reduce oven heat to 350 degrees.
* Once squash is done cooking, remove threads and place in a greased 8x8 baking dish.
* Place a large pan over medium heat. Add italian sausage and onion. Cook until pink no longer remains in the sausage and it is broken up into pieces.
* Add pizza sauce, dried basil and salt and pepper to the pan and mix well.
* Add sausage mixture to the 8x8 dish and mix well with spaghetti squash threads.
* Lastly, add whisked eggs to the baking dish and mix everything together until you can no longer see the eggs.
* Place in oven and bake for 1 hour or until the top of the mixture forms a slight crust that doesn't give when you press on it in the middle of the dish.
* Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
