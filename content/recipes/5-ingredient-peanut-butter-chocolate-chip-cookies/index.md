## Ingredients
* 1 cup creamy peanut butter
* 1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
* Mix all ingredients except chocolate chips. When blended, mix in the chocolate chips. Using your fingers, form 1 1/2 inch balls (dough will be very wet and sticky) and place onto an un-greased parchment lined cookie sheet. You don't want to make them too big because they do spread. Bake for 7-9 minutes. Let the cookies sit on the cookies sheet for about 30 seconds to 1 minute before letting cool on a wire rack. Don't let them cool on the sheet or they will overbake. The key to these is to not cook them too long! Makes around a dozen small cookies.
