## Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 cup diced yellow onion
* 1 pound lean ground beef
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 (1-ounce) package taco seasoning
* 1 cup long grain white rice, uncooked
* 2 1/2 cups chicken broth
* 1 1/4 cups salsa
* 1 cup grated cheddar cheese
* 1 cup chopped cilantro
* Optional toppings: diced tomatoes, avocado, sour cream, green onion, tortilla strips

## Directions
* Heat the olive oil in a skillet (*see note) over medium heat. Add in the diced onion and cook until softened.
* Add in the ground beef and continue cooking until browned. Add in the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
* Stir in the taco seasoning, rice, broth, and salsa. Bring the mixture up to a boil and then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook for 15 – 20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, stirring occasionally so rice doesn’t stick.
* Sprinkle in the cheese and cilantro and stir to combine. Remove the skillet from the heat, cover and let sit for 2 minutes for the cheese to melt. Season with salt and pepper if desired.
* Serve immediately with desired toppings.
