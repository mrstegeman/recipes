## Ingredients
* 1 pound bacon, cut into pieces
* 8 cloves of garlic, minced
* 2 yellow onion, chopped
* 12 oz baby carrots, diced
* 2 purple sweet potato, peeled and diced (any color will do)
* 1/2 cup tomato paste
* 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs
* 4 cups button or porcini mushrooms, sliced
* 4 cups red wine
* 3 cups chicken broth
* 8 bay leaves
* 2 teaspoons dry thyme
* salt, to taste throughout
* fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

## Directions
* Place stock pot over medium heat. Add bacon and cook until crispy. Then add garlic, onion, carrot and sweet potatoes. Add in a pinch of salt then toss in bacon fat and saute for about 8 minutes, until veggies begin to brown.
* Add in tomato paste and mix to combine with veggies. Then push veggies up onto the edge and sides of pan to make room for chicken. Pat chicken dry and salt each side then place into the middle of the hot pan. Let brown on both sides for about 3-5 minutes per side. Then add in mushrooms with a sprinkle of salt and cover to let cook and steam for another 3 minutes.
* Lastly, pour in red wine, chicken broth and add in bay leaves and thyme and mix to combine. Let simmer uncovered at a medium-low heat for about 60 minutes or until it reduces by â…“ and thickens.
* Remove bay leaves and thyme sprigs before serving. Serve with cauliflower mash on page 202 in Juli Bauer's Paleo Cookbook and garnish with fresh parsley.
