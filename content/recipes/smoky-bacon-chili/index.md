## Ingredients
* 6 sweet potatoes
* 1 package of bacon, cubed
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 yellow onions, diced
* 2 red peppers, diced
* 2 green peppers, diced
* 2 lbs ground beef
* 2 tablespoons garlic powder
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 4 tablespoons smoked paprika
* 2 teaspoons cumin
* 1 scant teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 2 (14) ounce cans of fire roasted tomatoes
* 1 (15) ounce can of tomato sauce
* salt and pepper, to taste
* chopped green onions

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Poke holes in your sweet potatoes with a fork. Place on rack in oven and cook for about 30 minutes or until potato is soft and cooked through.
* Now pull out a large pot, add the cubed bacon and let cook down.
* While the bacon is cooking, chop all the veggies.
* When the bacon has browned and is a bit crisp, add garlic clove and veggies.
* Let cook for about 6 or so minutes, then add your ground beef and all the spices. There's no need to drain the meat.
* Once the beef is browned, add your tomato sauce and fire roasted tomatoes.
* Mix well and let all the flavors meld together while cooking on low for the next 8 minutes or so, stirring occasionally.
* Then split open your sweet potato, pour your chili over it, and eat. Delicious
