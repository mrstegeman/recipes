## Ingredients
* ½ cup unsalted butter melted
* 2 large eggs at room temperature
* 2 medium bananas very ripe, roughly cut into chunks
* ⅓ cup sour cream
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* ½ teaspoon sea salt
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour

## Directions
* In a blender in this order combine melted butter, eggs, bananas, sour cream, vanilla extract, and sugar. Pulse the mixture until just blended, about 4 pulses.
* ½ cup unsalted butter, 2 large eggs, 2 medium bananas, ⅓ cup sour cream, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1 cup granulated sugar
* Add all the dry ingredients to the blender. Pulse an additional 4-5 times or until the mixture is just combined. Be careful not to overblend, as it can result in a dry and dense banana bread.
* ½ teaspoon sea salt, ½ teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
* Preheat the oven to 350°Fahrenheit (175°Celsius). Grease a 9×5 loaf pan or line it with parchment paper.
* Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
* Bake for 45 minutes. Then, loosely cover the bread with foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
* Allow the banana bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.
