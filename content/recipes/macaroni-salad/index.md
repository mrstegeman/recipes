## Ingredients
* 8 ounces dry elbow macaroni noodles
* Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
* 1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced
* 2 celery stalks, diced
* ½ cup diced dill pickles
* ⅓ cup diced red onion

### For the dressing
* ¾ cup mayonnaise
* 3 tablespoons dill pickle juice
* 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* 2 garlic cloves, grated
* ¼ teaspoon sea salt
* Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions
* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare the macaroni according to the package instructions, cooking until slightly past al dente. Drain and toss with a drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking, then set aside to cool.
* Make the dressing: In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, pickle juice, vinegar, sugar, mustard, garlic, salt, and several grinds of pepper.
* Add the macaroni, red pepper, celery, pickles, and red onion to the bowl with the dressing and stir to combine. Season to taste and chill until ready to serve.
