## Ingredients
* 2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (not instant)
* ¾ cup light brown sugar
* 1 cup walnuts or pecans, divided
* ½ cup raisins
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 2 large eggs
* 2 cups milk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing the dish
* 2 tart yet sweet baking apples, such as Honey Crisp, peeled and cut into ½-inch chunks (about 2 cups)

## Directions
* Preheat the oven to 325°F. Grease an 8 or 9-inch baking dish with butter.
* In a medium bowl, combine the oats, brown sugar, ½ cup of the nuts, raisins, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Mix well.
* In another bowl, break up the eggs with a whisk; then whisk in the milk and vanilla until well combined.
* Add the milk mixture to the oat mixture, along with the melted butter.
* Scatter the apples evenly on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Pour the oatmeal mixture over top and spread evenly. Sprinkle remaining ½ cup nuts on top. Bake for 40-45 minutes, until the top is golden and the oats are set. Serve warm or at room temperature.
