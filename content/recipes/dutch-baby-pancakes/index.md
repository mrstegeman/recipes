From [The Dashley's Kitchen](https://thedashleyskitchen.com/german-dutch-baby-pancake/).

## Ingredients
* 7 eggs
* 1 cup flour spooned
* 1 cup whole milk
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 3 tablespoons butter

## Directions
* Add eggs, flour, milk, salt and vanilla in blender. Mix until combined well.
* Melt butter in microwave and when hot pour into the 9x13 casserole dish. Making sure to coat both bottom and edges.
* Immediately pour batter into the casserole dish with butter and place on the middle rack of a cold oven.
* Close oven and set temperature to 375â„‰ and bake for 30 minutes. Avoid pre-heating oven (see note below).
* Serve while hot with dusted powdered sugar and lemon juice or whipped cream, fresh fruit and syrup.

## Notes
* Instead of scooping flour out of the container or bag with a measuring cup, (so that it becomes slightly compacted) spoon flour into the measuring cup till filled to ensure a more accurate measurement.
* Whole milk is preferred but not necessary if not on hand. Any variety will work.
* DO NOT preheat the oven. Placing the casserole dish in a cold oven allows the edges and center of the pancakes to cook a little more evenly. If oven is preheated, edges will cook quicker and the center does not have as much opportunity to rise and get fluffy.
* Do not be alarmed if pancakes seem to grow while in the oven. It will inflate significantly while baking and then immediately "wilt" after pulling out of the oven. It is supposed to do this.
